# Building Colette

---

## Dependencies

For building from source, Colette has the following dependencies:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.12.3 (Some older versions may be able to run Colette but have been untested. 3.10 is the bare minimum version.)
* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
* [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/)
* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

Install all of the dependencies as instructed for your operating system before building Colette.  You can run the following command to install the dependencies:

    pip(x) install -r requirements.txt

## Running the build script

An automated build script named **build.sh** is supplied with Colette's source code. This is the recommended way to build Colette and its documentation from source.

You may need to make the build script executable before being able to run it. If the script fails to execute, it is likely that you do not have execution permissions for it yet. In that case, make it executable with the following command:

    chmod +x build.sh

After making the script executable, run it like so:

    ./build.sh

## Running the compiled application

After building Colette, you can run it by navigating into one of the directories generated by PyInstaller (either **build/colette/** or **dist/colette/**) and typing the following command:

    ./colette

You can also run Colette without building it by running the **main.py** file from the **src/** directory.
