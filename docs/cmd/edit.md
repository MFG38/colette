## Description

Edits an entry in the todo list by its index. An interactive prompt will be launched where you will first be prompted for the index of the entry you wish to edit. You can then edit the description, type and due date of the entry. Specific parts of the editing prompt can be skipped by simply pressing Enter without typing anything - in this case, that part of the entry will be left unmodified.
