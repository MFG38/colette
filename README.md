# Colette

Colette is a WIP todo list manager that runs in the command line.

## Building Colette

As of yet, there is no readily provided building solution for Colette. That said, if you want to build Colette as a stand-alone application, you can probably do so using **PyInstaller** or something similar. A build script for Colette will be provided when the first stable version of the application is ready to be shipped.

## Using Colette

### Dependencies

Colette has the following dependencies:
* Python 3.12.3 (Some older versions may be able to run Colette but have been untested. 3.10 is the bare minimum version.)

### Running Colette

Running Colette is as simple as running `main.py` from the **src/** directory.
